Thanks for purchase Scope Pro asset.
Version 1.3.1

Require MFPS 1.9++

Get Started with MFPS:

- After import the asset in your MFPS project in order to test the scopes you can use the player prefab
  that comes in the asset folder, located in: Assets -> Addons -> ScopePro -> Resources -> MPlayer[ScopePro],
  set this player as one of the players in GameData of MFPS, then play the game and check the Rifle and the Sniper weapon.
  
- Add Scope Pro to a sniper:
  in order to add the sniper scope effect to a new sniper, first drag the prefab 'ScopeProSetup' inside (in hierarchy) of your FPSniper,
  the prefab is located in: Assets -> Addons -> ScopePro -> Prefabs -> ScopeProSetup, 
   
   - In the ScopeProSetup object will be a bl_SniperScopeSetup.cs script attached, in this you need assign the player camera in the "Player Camera" field.
   - Your weapon model should have a Scope/glass separated mesh, you have to drag this mesh to bl_SniperScopeSetup -> Normal Mesh and them click on "Setup Scope".
   - Now in the weapon where bl_Gun.cs script is attached, add the script bl_ScopeProWeapon.cs

   -if you want to change the scope texture, you can change the scope material in the Squad mesh located in: ScopePro -> ScopeCamera -> Texture.

- Add reflex material:
  Create a new material and select the shader MFPS -> Sights -> Red Dot.
  and assign a red dot texture.
  In your sight model, select the glass separated mesh and add the material
  play with the shader properties until you get the desired results.
